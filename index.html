<div>

  <p>The Lattice Quantum Chromo-Dynamics (LQCD) ASCR/NP SciDAC
  Project is supported by the U.S. Dept. of Energy Office of Nuclear
  Physics and the Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research.
  This SciDAC project focuses on an ambitious program of theoretical,
  algorithmic and software development which will enable calculations
  using lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (LQCD) methods to exploit the
  new generation of leadership-class resources and dedicated hardware
  to address fundamental questions in nuclear science. Specifically,
  our project will impact our understanding of results from current
  heavy ion experiments at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC),
  the study of excited and exotic states of hadrons at CLAS-12 and
  GlueX at Jefferson Lab (JLab) and the hadron and nuclear structure
  programs at RHIC-spin and JLab. The calculations that are enabled by
  the proposed developments will also look forward to experiments on
  protons and nuclei at the upcoming Electron-Ion Collider (EIC).</p>

      <br/>
      <p>
The goal of nuclear physics is to describe all matter from its simplest building blocks: quarks and gluons. Found deep inside protons and neutrons, quarks and gluons also combine in less common configurations to make other subatomic particles of matter. For scientists, producing these less-common particles in experiments is an interesting challenge. A new theory method aids in those efforts by predicting which less-common particles an experiment will produce.

      <br/>
      <p>
      For the first time in lattice QCD, a calculation has shown the
 presence of an exotic $1^{-+}$ state appearing as an unstable
 <i>resonance</i>. The result shows that the longstanding model-based
 proposal that such a state would couple more strongly to the $\pi
 b_1$ final-state than the lower-lying $\pi \eta, \pi \eta'$ and $\pi
 \rho$ final-states is confirmed. Possible implications for the
 recently observed $\pi_1$ experimental candidate state are discussed.

      <p>
      <i>Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 082001 (2021)</i>
      <br/>
      <p>We introduce novel relations between derivatives of the Dirac eigenvalue spectrum with respect to the light sea quark mass and the $(n+1)$-point correlations among the eigenvalues of the massless Dirac operator. Using these relations we present LQCD results for the derivatives at light pion masses and at a temperature of about 1.6 times the chiral phase transition temperature.  We find that eigenvalue density develops a peaked structure.  We demonstrate that this phenomena is responsible for the manifestations of axial anomaly in two-point correlation functions of light scalar and pseudoscalar mesons. After continuum and chiral extrapolations we find that axial anomaly remains manifested in two-point correlation functions of scalar and pseudoscalar mesons in the chiral limit.

      </h3>
      <p>
      <i>Phys.Rev.Lett. 126 (2021) 20, 202001</i>
      <br/>
      <p>
The fraction of the longitudinal momentum of $3^{}{\rm He}_3$ that is carried by the isovector combination of $u$ and $d$ quarks is determined using lattice QCD for the first time.
The ratio of this combination to that in the constituent nucleons is found to be consistent with unity at the few-percent level from calculations with quark masses corresponding to $m_\pi\sim 800$~MeV, extrapolated to the physical quark masses.
This constraint is consistent with, and significantly more precise
 than, determinations from global nuclear parton distribution function
 fits. Including  the lattice QCD  determination of the momentum
 fraction in the nNNPDF global fitting framework results in the
 uncertainty on the isovector momentum fraction ratio being reduced by
 a factor of 2.5, and thereby enables a more precise extraction of the
 $u$ and $d$ parton distributions in $3^{}{\rm He}_3$.

      <br/>
      <p>
Extraction of hadronic observables at finite momenta from LQCD is constrained by the well-known signal-to-noise problems afflicting all such LQCD calculations. In this work we extend the idea of  momentum-smearing by exploring modifications to the distillation framework. Together with enhanced time slice sampling and expanded operator bases engendered by distillation, we find ground-state nucleon energies can be extracted reliably for $\vec{p}\le 3$ GeV and matrix elements featuring a large momentum dependence can be resolved.

          NERSC's Cori System Reveals Integral Role of Gluons in Proton Pressure Distribution

      For the first time, lattice QCD calculations run at NERSC
      allowed nuclear physicists to determine the pressure
      distribution inside a proton, taking into account the
      contributions of the proton’s fundamental particles: quarks and
      gluons. This discovery brings nuclear scientists closer to a
      complete understanding of a proton’s structure and the
      fundamental particles that make up most of the visible matter in
      the universe.

      <i>SciDAC Highlight, 2018-05-01</i>
      <br/><br/>
The generation of gauge configurations (samples of the strong force
      field in the vacuum) is the gating first step of nuclear and
      high energy physics calculations using lattice quantum
      chromodynamics (LQCD) generating the data on which subsequent
      calculations depend. 
Here, we demonstrate a 73x reduction in the GPU-hours required for the generation of such gauge fields
       moving from Titan to Summit, and incorporating new algorithms
      well suited to the new system. The improvement on  Summit enables calculations which where hitherto considered out-of reach for reasons of computational cost, and will fundamentally re-shape how we will conduct our scientific campaigns in the future.
